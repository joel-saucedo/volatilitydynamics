# volatility dynamics
Objectives:
1. Utilize the arbitrage-free pricing theory and liquidity assumptions to demonstrate that the market's collective estimation of volatility through option pricing converges to actual volatility in the limit. This will be done in Black_Sholes_Merton.py

2. Apply the theory of stationary stochastic processes and empirical observations of financial markets to show that high-frequency data exhibit patterns that can be captured and used for predictive modeling.

3. Leverage the properties of fractional Brownian motion, especially its self-similarity and long-range dependence, to establish its effect on modeling financial markets' volatility.

4. Post process the obatined data from the first 3 operations to create volatility signals and parametrizations in preparation for the final integration of the model.

5. We argue that the combined model, which incorporates diverse volatility signals, reduces forecast error through diversification and a more comprehensive capture of market dynamics.
